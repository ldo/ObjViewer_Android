To build the ObjViewer app for Android, you will need the Android SDK,
available from <http://developer.android.com/>, along with its
prerequisites, including a Java developer kit (either OpenJDK or the
Sun JDK) and Ant.

You will need to add a couple of files to the top of the source
tree: local.properties, and keystore.properties. These are excluded
from the Git repository because their contents are specific to your
setup.

local.properties defines a property sdk.dir, which points to the
top-level directory where you installed the Android SDK. E.g.

    sdk.dir=/path/to/android-sdk-linux_x86

keystore.properties defines three properties to do with signing of
the application package: keystore.path is the path to your keystore
file, keystore.alias is the name (alias) of the key in the keystore
to use, and keystore.password is the password for accessing that key.
E.g.

    keystore.path=/home/ldo/my.keystore
    keystore.alias=my-key
    keystore.password=please

Because it has to contain a password, I would recommend you do NOT make
this file readable by anybody but its owner.

If you don't already have a keystore, you can create one with
the JDK keytool command, something like this:

    keytool -genkeypair -keystore keystorename -storepass keystorepassword \
        -keyalg RSA -validity $((25 * 365)) -alias keyalias -keysize 2048 \
        -dname "CN=J Random Hacker, O=HackerCo, L=Anytown, ST=Anystate, C=US"

substituting your own filename for keystorename, your own password
for keystorepassword, your own name for the key for keyalias, and of course
your own identification details in the value for -dname.

Now you should be able to build the complete package with the
following command:

    ant signed

If this completes without errors, you should have a file
bin/ObjViewer-release.apk, which is the application package.

You can also install this automatically to an Android device
connected via USB. First, make sure "USB Debugging" is enabled
on that device. Now do

    ant install

which will invoke the building and signing, and then install the
package on the default connected Android device.
